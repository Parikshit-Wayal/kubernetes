# 📘 **Readiness Probe :

---

## 🔹 Step 1: What is a Readiness Probe?

A **Readiness Probe** is a health check used by Kubernetes to decide:

👉 **Should this pod receive traffic or not?**

- ✅ If readiness probe **passes** → pod **receives traffic**
- ❌ If readiness probe **fails** → pod is **removed from service traffic**

📌 **Important**  
Readiness probe **does NOT restart the container**.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Why Do We Need a Readiness Probe?

In real applications:

- App may start, but **DB is not connected**
- App may become **temporarily unavailable**
- App may be **overloaded**

In these cases:

- App should **stay running**
- But **should NOT receive traffic**

👉 **This is exactly what the readiness probe solves.**

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Pod Creation and Initial State

When the deployment is applied, the pod starts running.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

At the beginning, the pod may show 0/1 READY because the readiness probe has not passed yet.

📌 Meaning

Pod is Running

But it is NOT ready to receive traffic

## 🔹 Step 4: Readiness Probe Endpoint in Application

We created a `/ready` endpoint in the application.

**Behavior:**

- First 30 seconds → app is **READY**
- After 30 seconds → app becomes **NOT READY**

**Code logic (simple meaning):**

- If app runtime `< 30 sec` → return **200 (READY)**
- If app runtime `> 30 sec` → return **503 (NOT READY)**

📌 **Important**  
This simulates a real dependency failure (for example, DB down).

---
## 🔹 Step 5: Readiness Probe in Kubernetes YAML

Kubernetes continuously calls the `/ready` endpoint.

**What Kubernetes does:**

- Calls `/ready` every **5 seconds**
- If response is **200** → pod is marked **READY**
- If response is **503** → pod is marked **NOT READY**

📌 **Important**  
Kubernetes does **not kill the pod**, it only controls traffic.

---


## 🔹 Step 6: Service Creation

A Kubernetes **Service** is created to expose the pod.

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

<br>
📌 Important
Service sends traffic only to READY pods.

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Endpoints Behavior (Most Important Concept)

You monitored service endpoints:

```bash
kubectl get endpoints readiness-service -w
```
<img width="558" height="168" alt="endpoint" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c7f909e-16c1-4fe4-8f72-b89a4d5d5a91" />
Meaning:

<none> → No pod is ready → no traffic

Pod IP appears → Pod is ready → traffic allowed

📌 Important
Readiness probe directly controls service endpoints.

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Events Showing Readiness Probe Failure

You checked pod events:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
You saw:

<br>

Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode 503
📌 Important

❌ Container is NOT restarted

❌ Pod is NOT deleted

✅ Only traffic is stopped

---


## 🔹 Step 9: Pod Status Change (Key Observation)

You ran:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```
Output:
<img width="937" height="250" alt="pod" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00227f20-4e37-4ce8-a48b-f3e6cc5ad9ac" />
<>

Copy code
READY   STATUS
0/1     Running
1/1     Running
📌 Meaning

Running → container is alive

0/1 → pod is NOT receiving traffic

1/1 → pod is receiving traffic

---
## 🔹 Step 10: Traffic Test Using Curl
You tested traffic via the service.

When Readiness FAILED
bash
```
curl readiness-service
```
<img width="704" height="200" alt="failes to connect" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e8d10c5-3d81-478d-bbd0-be36eaabee90" />
📌 Reason

Pod was NOT ready

Service had no endpoints

Traffic was blocked

When Readiness PASSED
bash
```
curl readiness-service
```
<img width="632" height="193" alt="running" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba717392-8cb8-4f67-b912-f5c847592a1b" />
<br>
Response

App is running
📌 Traffic works because the pod is READY.

🔹 Step 11: Final Flow Summary
When Readiness Probe FAILS
Pod status → Running

READY → 0/1

Endpoints → none

Traffic → ❌ stopped

Restart → ❌ NO

When Readiness Probe PASSES
Pod status → Running

READY → 1/1

Endpoints → Pod IP

Traffic → ✅ allowed

🔹 Final One-Line Summary 
Readiness probe checks whether a pod is ready to receive traffic. If it fails, Kubernetes removes the pod from service endpoints without restarting it, ensuring traffic is routed only to ready and healthy pods.
